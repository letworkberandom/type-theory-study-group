4. System F, Type-Safety, and Parametricity
5. Finite Data Types, Infinite Data Types, and the Bar Induction Principle
6. Linear Type Theory, Game Semantics and Vector Space Semantics
7. Set-Theoretic Perspectives on Type Theories, Types as Generalized Topological Spaces, and Elementary Topos Theory
8. Dana Scott's Logic for Computable Functions, and Meaning Theory
9. Proof Refinement Logics, Computational Type Theories, and Interesting Proofs in Open-Ended Computation Systems
10. Homotopy-theoretic Models of Type Theory, Higher Type Theory, and Achieving Alexander Grothendieck's Goal for a Formal Axiomatic Theory of Infinity Groupoids
